                                    <p>You’ve come to our website and you’re probably wondering: “Who are these guys and what are they trying to do?”. We’ve asked ourselves that same question a few times too. </p><br />  
                             <p><b><span class="text-color">Our goal is simple: Change the way you make your dreams come true by providing you with valuable content, knowledge and resources to help you on your way.</span></b></p><br />

                            <p>Our vision is for Baalti List to be a website that allows you to articulate, manage, research and achieve the life experiences that you have on your bucket list (Baalti List). We provide a more interactive and engaging experience for you than existing, static bucket list management websites by giving you original content and the information necessary to start and complete your journey.  Most of all we’re building Baalti List with a beautiful and intuitive design that makes it easy to use so you focus on pursuing your goals rather than learning another website.</p><br />

<p>Baalti List is meant to be a tool along each of your journeys that keeps you engaged with your dreams, well informed on what is required to complete your goals and keeps you on the path to achieving your dream experiences. It’s as simple as <b><span class="text-color">Dream. Baalti. Go!</span></b></p><br />
                             
        <p><b><span class="text-color">Dream:</span></b> Enter your bucket list entries along with a self-imposed completion dates for each one.</p><br />

<p><b><span class="text-color">Baalti:</span></b> Next we provide you with as much relevant and valuable content in the form of a personalized web experience. Think of the experience as a lifestyle magazine published only for you. This can range from travel guides (How about a weekend in NYC?) to video lessons (sushi anyone?) to vendors/service provider recommendations and a community of people who have completed, or are interested in completing, the same activities.</p><br />

<p>As your planning completion date approaches we provide you with reminders that make planning easy and enjoyable.</p><br />

<p><b><span class="text-color">Go!</span></b> Now you’ve got the information and a well planned activity it’s time to go out there and get it done!</p>
